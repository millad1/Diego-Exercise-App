The main screen will have a tab (or drop-down menu) where you can access various functions that are necessary to add convenience and direction to the fitness app. For instance, the tab (drop-down menu) would link to other features such as an option tab where you may change settings such as text size, location services (whether you want to show your location or not). Another important feature in that tab section would be a tab to access your account, where all your info will be shown for your own record. Here you would be able to see your friends you connected with on the app or even be able to sign out of your account. The drop-down menu would be an essential part of the fitness app as it will help it look more organized and much easier for a user to navigate. 
The list of features:
-Drop down menu (side of screen) or menu at the bottom/top of the screen that shows the various places you can be taken to on the app
**The following are the available places you can access on said menu: account, schedule, options
-Account would serve as the default menu, where you may look at your progress on the fitness app, look at the number of friends you have there, options to edit your account or sign out.
-Schedule would take you to another screen where a calendar would be shown, and it will list out the amount of time spent exercising and time you should be spending or time you want to spend exercising. The exercises recommended to you would be listed here as well, possibly with a goal in mind each day as the app continually tracks your progress
-Options would be another screen where you may change your preferences or lay out of the app. Here, text size may be changed for those who are visually impaired or other features such as location services, hiding recommendations, keeping your profile hidden from others, units of measurement (miles or kilometers), etc. Things to aesthetically please the user.
